# Algorithms
Some small tests I've done in my free time. There are basic things such as arithmetic operations and string treatments, but it also includes pointers and two dimensional arrays exercises as well. I'm publishing these code fragments because I might consult them later.

## Note:
Most of the variable names and comments are in portuguese.
